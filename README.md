# MushroomAnalyzer
App to analyze mushroom edibility

The code to use Weka outside of the app is located in the Classifier Creator folder.
Everything else is for the app.
Note: The official Weka release cannot be used in mobile devices. Refer to https://github.com/rjmarsan/Weka-for-Android for the edited version that we used.
