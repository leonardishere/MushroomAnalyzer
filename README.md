# MushroomAnalyzer
App to analyze mushroom edibility

The app is available for download at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.leonardishere.mushroomanalyzer

The code to use Weka outside of the app is located in the Classifier Creator folder.

Everything else is for the app.

Note: The official Weka release cannot be used in mobile devices. Refer to https://github.com/rjmarsan/Weka-for-Android for the edited version that we used.
